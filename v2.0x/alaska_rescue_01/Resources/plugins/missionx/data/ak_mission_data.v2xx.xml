         <![CDATA[Smith: Thank god someone heard my call, I thought my communications went down before the message went through. I need your help locating a friend (Joe) who went fishing but seemed to get injured, just don't ask me how he manged to do that. It is not a bad injury a broken or sprain leg I think. Please try to locate him SW from here, around 7 to 9 miles. I Think he is somewhere near the bank of POQ seaport, He likes to fish there. He has a red oar boat, keep low to locate it.;;After you find him please Fly to Ketchikan International, from there he will be taken to Ketchikan General Hospital.;;Good Luck and Thanks.]]>
